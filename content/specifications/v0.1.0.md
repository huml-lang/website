# HUML specification v0.1.0 <sup class="tag">Experimental</sup>

HUML is a machine-readable markup language with a focus on readability by humans. It borrows YAML's visual appearance, but avoids its complexities, ambiguities, and dangerous footguns. It is very strict about indentation and spaces specifically to ensure consistent form across contexts for readability.

HUML is tailored for configuration, documents, and datasets.


## Encoding and basic structure

* UTF-8 encoding.
* Line breaks: Unix-style (`\n`).
* Blank lines are ignored.
* Optional version directive at the top: `%HUML <version>` (e.g., `%HUML v0.1.0`). If this is not present, a parser is to apply the latest version of the specification.

## Data types

HUML supports scalar (string, number, bool, null) and vector (list, dict) data types.

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                         | Example                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **String**  | Only canonical (decoded) representation of Unicode strings. No `\u` or `\U` or any other escaped or encoded representations.        | Allowed: `"Hello üåè"`<br>Not allowed: `"Hello \u1F30F"`    |
|             | **Single-line string**: Always quoted with double quotes. `"` and `\` must be escaped.                                              | `"foo"`, `"Hello World"`, `"Hi \"all\""`, `"Back\\Slash"` |
|             | **Multi-line string**: Wrapped in ``` (three backticks) to preserve spaces or `"""` (three double quotes) to strip them.            |                                                           |
|             | Characters inside a multi-line string do not need to be escaped. Escape sequences with backslashes like `\n` are treated literally. |                                                           |
| **Number**  | **Integer**                                                                                                                         | `123`, `+123`, `-123`                                     |
|             | **Float** (64-bit, IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point)                                                                        | `3.14`, `-0.5`                                            |
|             | **Special values**. The special numerical values are unquoted.                                                                      | `nan`, `inf`, `+inf`, `-inf`                              |
|             | *Notations*                                                                                                                         |                                                           |
|             | **Exponent**, denoted by a lowercase `e`                                                                                            | `1e10`, `6.022e23`                                        |
|             | **Hex**, begins with `0x`                                                                                                           | `0x1A`, `0xCAFE`                                          |
|             | **Octal**, begins with `0o`                                                                                                         | `0o12`, `0o755`                                           |
|             | **Binary**, begins with `0b`                                                                                                        | `0b1010`, `0b11011001`                                    |
|             | Numbers can have arbitrary underscore characters for readability, which are simply ignored while parsing.                           | `1_00_0000`                                               |

| **List**    | Array of arbitrary data types.                                                                                                      | `1, 2, "three"`                                           |
|             | Definition can be inline or multi-line.                                                                                             |                                                           |
|             | Multi-line items are prefixed with a `-`, like a bullet point list.                                                                 |                                                           |
|             | `[]` is a special signifier used to denote an empty list, e.g., `items:: []`.                                                       | `[]`                                                      |
| **Dict**    | Unordered map of key-value pairs. Keys are strings and values can be of arbitrary data types.                                       | `hello: "world", num: 123`                                |
|             | Definition can be inline or multi-line.                                                                                             |                                                           |
|             | Duplicate keys inside a dict are not allowed.                                                                                       |                                                           |
|             | `{}` is a special signifier used to denote an empty dict, e.g., `items:: {}`.                                                       | `{}`                                                      |

------------

## Indentation

* Strictly 2 spaces per indentation level. For multi-line list and dict vector definitions, indentation represents hierarchy.

------------

## Spaces
The presence of space characters is strictly controlled.
* Trailing spaces are not allowed on any line, including empty lines and comment-only lines, except for content within multi-line strings, where they are treated as content.
* The comment marker `#` must be immediately followed by one space before the comment contents, e.g., `# Comment` and not `#Comment`.
* Only a single space is allowed after the indicators `:`, `::`, and `-` and before the subsequent value.
* For multi-line vectors, `::` must be immediately followed by a line break, unless it is a comment starting with `#`.
* In inline lists, commas must not have preceding spaces and must be followed by exactly one space, e.g., `1, 2, 3`.

------------

## Comments

* Lines beginning with `#` are comments. Comments can have preceding spaces, but not trailing spaces.
* After `#`, there must be at least one space before any other character.

```huml
# Comment-only line
key: "value"         # Inline comment with a lot of preceding spaces.
```

------------

## Keys and values

- Keys are case-sensitive Unicode strings.
  - If (alphanumeric-underscore-dash) `a-zA-Z0-9_-` and starting with an alphabet, the key does not need to be quoted.<br />e.g., `foo: 123, foo-bar: "yes", foo1: true`
  - If any other characters, including spaces, are present, keys must be quoted.<br />e.g., `"1foo": 123, "foo bar": 123, "‡¥≠‡µÇ‡¥Æ‡¥ø": "Earth"`
- Scalar keys are denoted by the key followed by a single colon (`:`).
- Vector keys are denoted by the key followed by double colons (`::`).
- No spaces are allowed before the `:` or `::`, and they must be followed by exactly one space before the value.
- The root of the document does not need a `:` or `::` at the top as the entire document's type is inferred from the first value that is encountered in the document.

------------

## Scalars

Scalars (string, number, boolean, null) are denoted by a single colon (`:`).

```huml
key: "value"
number: 123
boolean: true
type: null
```

### Strings
Strings can only be represented in their canonical (decoded) form. That is, encoded representations such as `\u` and `\U` are not permitted to ensure consitency and readability.

### Single-line strings
Single-line strings may include the following formatting control characters using C-style escape notation with backslashes.

| Escape | Description     |
| :----- | :-------------- |
| `\b`   | Backspace       |
| `\f`   | Form feed       |
| `\n`   | Newline (LF)    |
| `\r`   | Carriage return |
| `\t`   | Horizontal tab  |
| `\v`   | Vertical tab    |


### Multi-line strings

In multi-line string blocks, no escaping is necessary. Characters are treated literally. As the beginning and ending markers can be derived from the indentation, there is no need to escape the three double quotes or backticks themselves in the string content.

#### Preserve spaces: ******` ``` `******
The content block must be indented by one level (2 spaces) relative to the key. These initial 2 spaces on each line is the minimum required indentation and is not considered as spaces. All other preceding and all trailing spaces are preserved as content. The opening indicator ******` ``` `****** must be after the indicator `:` separated by exactly one space. The closing indicator must be at the indentation level of the key.

````huml
description: ```
  Line 1
   Line 2
    Line 3
          All spaces are preserved.
```
````

is parsed as:

```
Line 1
 Line 2
  Line 3
        All spaces are preserved.
```

#### Strip spaces: ******`"""`******
The content block must be indented by one level (2 spaces) relative to the key. All leading and trailing whitespace on each line of content is stripped. The opening indicator ******`"""`****** must be after the indicator `:` separated by exactly one space. The closing indicator must be at the indentation level of the key.


```huml
description: """
  Line 1
   Line 2
    Line 3
         All spaces are ignored.   
"""
```

is parsed as:
```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
All spaces are ignored.
```

------------

## Vectors

Vectors are denoted by double colons (`::`) and can be lists (arrays) or dicts (unordered key-value maps or dictionaries).

### Lists

* **Inline:** Comma-separated without trailing commas. Inline list items can only be scalar values and cannot contain vectors or nesting. They are meant to be a readability shortcut for small lists.
* **Multi-line:** A hyphen `-` denotes a list item, indented by 2 spaces relative to its parent. Multi-line lists can be nested and can contain vectors.
* **Empty list:** A vector can be marked as an empty list with the special value `[]`.

```huml
inline_list:: 1, 2, "three"

multiline_list::
  - 1
  - 2
  - "three"

# [1, 2, "three", [1, 2, "three"]]
nested_list::
  - 1
  - 2
  - "three"
  - ::
    - 1
    - 2
    - "three"

# [{"one": 1, "foo": "bar"}, {"two": 2, "foo": "baz"}]
list_of_dicts::
   - ::
     one: 1
     foo: "bar"
   - ::
     two: 2
     foo: "baz"

empty_list:: []
```

### Dicts

* **Inline:** Keys inside a dict are `key: value` pairs, comma-separated without trailing commas. Inline dicts can only contain scalar key-values and cannot contain vectors or nesting. They are meant to be a readability shortcut for small dictionaries.
* **Multi-line:** Keys inside a dict are `key: value` on a line indented by 2 spaces relative to its parent. Multi-line dicts can be nested and can contain vectors.
* **Empty dict:** A vector can be marked as an empty dict with the special value `{}`.

```huml
inline_dict:: one: 1, foo: "bar"

multiline_dict::
  one: 1
  foo: "bar"

# {"one": 1, "foo": "bar", "nested": {"two": 2, "foo": "baz"}}
nested_dict::
  one: 1
  foo: "bar"
  nested::
    two: 2
    foo: "baz"

empty_dict:: {}
```

------------------

# Example

## Why `::`?

1) The indicator `::` immediately makes it apparent that what follows is a vector, to both human readers and parsers. Less guessing.

```huml
# Inline list: [1, 2, 3, "four"]
foo:: 1, 2, 3, "four"

# Inline dict: {"foo": {"bar": "baz", "one": 1}}
foo:: bar: "baz", one: 1

# Multi-line list
foo::
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3

# Multi-line dict
foo::
  bar: "baz"
  one: 1
```

2) It permits vectors to be defined inline without additional syntax such as `[ ... ]` or `{ ... }`. Opening and closing enclosures bring in complexities of keeping track of nesting and balancing closures, both for humans and parsers.

```huml
# This is a list with one item: key = ["one"]
key:: "one"

# Without :: it is not possible to represent an inline list
# without an enclosure such as [ ... ]. For example, key: ["one"]
# Here, key = "one"
key: "one"
```

3) It avoids several ambiguities. In YAML, for example:
```yaml
# Although this looks like a list, it is a string: foo = "1, 2, 3"
foo: 1, 2, 3

# Square brackets denote a list.
foo: [1, 2, 3]

# Square brackets over multiple lines are also a list.
foo: [
1,
 2,
  3,
]

# And this is also a list.
foo:
- 1
- 2
- 3

# Although this looks like a nested list,
# it actually translates to: {"foo": ["1 - 2 - 3"]}
# WUT?
foo:
 - 1
  - 2
  - 3
```

## Document root

An empty HUML document (ignoring comments) is by default considered undefined. Since the root of the document does not have a key, an explicit indicator `:` or `::` is not required. The document's type is inferred dynamically from the first encounter of vector or scalar values. Any subsequent type or value that appears throws a parser error, unless they are child elements of a vector.

Various scenarios are illustrated below.

The document is evaluated to the boolean `true`. No subsequent keys, values, or data types are permitted.
```huml
true
```

The document is evaluated to the string `"Hello, world"`. No subsequent keys, values, or data types are permitted.
```huml
"Hello, world"
```

The document is evaluated to the list `[1, 2, "three"]`. Note that there is no `::` indicator at the root as the vector value is directly at the root of the document without a key. No subsequent keys, values, or data types are permitted outside of the list elements. Since this is an inline list, no nesting is permitted either.
```huml
1, 2, "three"
```

The document is evaluated to the list `[1, 2, "three"]`. Note that there is no `::` indicator at the root as the vector value is directly at the root of the document without a key. No subsequent keys, values, or data types are permitted outside of the list elements.
```huml
- 1
- 2
- "three"
```

The document is evaluated to the dict `{"foo": 1, "bar": "two"}`. Note that there is no `::` indicator at the root as the vector value is directly at the root of the document without a parent key. Since this is an inline dict, no further nesting is permitted.
```huml
foo: 1, bar: "two"
```

The document is evaluated to the dict `{"foo": 1, "bar": "two", "baz": {"foo": "child"}}`. Note that there is no `::` indicator at the root as the vector value is directly at the root of the document without a key. Since the whole document in itself is now a dict, new keys and arbitrary nested types under them are permitted.
```huml
foo: 1
bar: "two"
baz::
  foo: "child"
```

The document is evaluated to the empty dict `{}` (special indicator). No subsequent keys, values, or data types are permitted.
```huml
{}
```

The document is evaluated to the empty list `[]` (special indicator). No subsequent keys, values, or data types are permitted.
```huml
[]
```
